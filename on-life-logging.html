  On Life-Logging<br><br>
  <p>I spent two years tracking everything I did, every minute of the day. </p>
  <p>I did this by writing entries in a text file. Each entry had a starting timestamp, an ending timestamp, and a natural language description. Here&#39;s a sample: </p>
  <pre><code>
  02/12/22 01:14 02/12/22 10:00 I slept.
  02/12/22 10:00 02/12/22 10:24 I ate breakfast.
  02/12/22 10:24 02/12/22 11:51 I wrote in my wiki about Project G.
  02/12/22 11:51 02/12/22 12:09 I made coffee and talked to my mother.
  </code></pre>
  <p>I also wrote a program that would graph the number of a times a keyword appeared in my log over time, which allowed me to visualize my behavior.</p>
  <p>I eventually came to the reasonable conclusion that life-logging is not useful. Tracking sleep, diet, and fitness can help optimize health. Tracking productivity, mood, and social activity may also lend some insights. Other than that, there&#39;s nothing to be learned from life-logging. It&#39;s interesting to have a record of what you were doing at any point in time, but not interesting enough to be worth the effort.</p>
