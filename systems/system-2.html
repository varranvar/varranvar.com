    <h1>a minimal tabletop role-playing game suited for online play</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Motivation:<ul>
          <li>Traditional TTRPGs, while possessing a certain charm in person, have too many complex character sheets and
            tedious rules to hold a player&#39;s attention in online play</li>
          <li>Simpler TTRPGs, like <a href="https://gshowitt.itch.io/honey-heist">Honey Heist</a> have less friction and
            are more story-telling oriented, which can create a more immersive experience for the players</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Design:<ul>
          <li>Character are defined by a list of properties, such as proficiencies, deficiencies, traits, physical
            attributes, relationships, items, and any other relevant information<ul>
              <li>For example, Turtle-Person:<ul>
                  <li>is a turtle-human hybrid<ul>
                      <li>has a hard shell</li>
                      <li>is amphibious</li>
                      <li>is vegan</li>
                      <li>is slow on land</li>
                      <li>is fast in water</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>is stealthy</li>
                  <li>has a wooden staff</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When an player wants to make an action:<ol>
              <li>Have them roll a 6-sided dice</li>
              <li>If the character has a relevant property that would give them an advantage or disadvantage in the
                situation, have them roll a second 6-sided dice and pick the highest or lowest roll accordingly<ul>
                  <li>For example, Turtle-Person would make a disadvantage roll when running away from an enemy but an
                    advantage roll when swimming away</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>1 is a great failure, 2 is a failure, 3 is a slight failure, 4 is a slight success, 5 is a success,
                and 6 is a great success</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
