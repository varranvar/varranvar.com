  On Knowledge Management<br><br>
  <p>I&#39;ve tried many knowledge management systems in the past few years. My general impression is that while note-taking is supremely useful for critical thinking, complex note-taking systems add very little value and mostly just serve to make the user feel more productive. Here are a few of my insights.</p>
  <p>The first insight I&#39;ve had is that the vast majority of the value in note-taking comes from writing, not re-visiting. Writing allows you to record your chain of thought, so you can revisit earlier points in the chain. It allows your thinking to become breadth-first rather than depth-first, which is great for reasoning about complex problems. That being said, I rarely ever revisit my notes. If there are any useful insights, then I naturally remember them because they were useful. If I need detailed information on a topic, I&#39;m better off looking it up than trying to gather bits of information scattered throughout my notes. This is why I think the type of linking encouraged by Zettelkasten wikis is not useful. On the rare occasion I do need to find something in my notes, a semantic search is plenty sufficient.</p>
  <p>The second insight I&#39;ve had is that it is essential to reduce the time it takes from having an idea to writing it down. Friction in the note-taking process will discourage you. Writing in paragraph form adds friction. Having discrete, named notes adds friction. My solution is to have an auto-generated daily note in a bullet-point format where I can write whatever I want, without worrying about structuring or formatting. This system encourages me to record all my thoughts, no matter how incoherent or irrelevant. If there&#39;s some idea I want to make presentable, I can extract it into its own well-structured and formatted note. This is also called the &quot;babble and prune&quot; method.</p>
  <p>There are two other areas in knowledge management that I think could be useful. The first is a system to store and search through large amounts of content, like web pages and books. This sort of thing already exists, but I&#39;ve yet to find one that I like. The second is a system to write and share highly structured logical arguments. <a href="https://www.kialo.com/">Kialo</a> is an example of this, but I believe something more expressive would be better.</p>
